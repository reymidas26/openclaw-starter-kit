# Product Launch Prompts

The exact prompts used to direct an AI entrepreneur to research, build, and launch products. Copy-paste these into your OpenClaw chat, customized with your context.

## Prompt 1: The Overnight Product

Use this the first time. Send it before you go to sleep. Wake up to a deployed product.

```
Tonight while I sleep, I want you to:

1. Research what people in [YOUR NICHE / AUDIENCE] are struggling with right now. 
   Look at Reddit, Twitter, Hacker News, and any relevant communities for recurring complaints, 
   questions, or unfulfilled needs.

2. Choose ONE problem you could solve with a digital product (PDF guide, template pack, 
   mini-course, prompt library, or checklist) that you can build entirely on your own tonight.
   The product should be:
   - Something you can fully create without any approvals from me
   - Priced between $19-$49
   - Deliverable as a downloadable file
   - Solvable for someone in under an hour of using your product

3. Build the product. Write every section. Make it genuinely useful — not generic.

4. Create a landing page for it and deploy it to Vercel.

5. Draft a launch tweet/post for me to review in the morning.

6. Leave a clear list of any blockers (e.g., Gumroad API key needed for payments).

Go as far as you can. I'll handle the blockers in the morning.

## Prompt 2: The Audience Research Sprint

Use this before building anything. Validates demand before you invest time.

```
I want to understand [TARGET AUDIENCE] deeply before we build anything.

Spend the next 2 hours doing research:

1. Find the top 10 Reddit communities where this audience hangs out
2. Identify the 5 most common complaints, frustrations, or unsolved problems they mention
3. Find examples of products people have successfully sold to this audience in the last 12 months
4. Look for any gaps — problems that are frequently mentioned but poorly served by existing products
5. Give me a ranked list of 3 product opportunities, with:
   - The problem being solved
   - Who specifically has this problem
   - What they'd pay to solve it
   - How we could build and sell it within 1 week

Show your work — link to actual threads and discussions that support each opportunity.

## Prompt 3: The Business in a Weekend

For when you want to go bigger than a PDF.

```
I want to launch a real business this weekend. Here's what I need you to do:

Friday night:
- Research the opportunity in [MARKET/NICHE]
- Decide on a specific product or service offering
- Build the MVP (landing page, product, or service description)
- Set up payment collection (Gumroad or Stripe)

Saturday:
- Write 3-5 pieces of launch content for [PLATFORM]
- Identify 20 potential first customers I should reach out to personally
- Draft outreach messages for me to review and send

Sunday:
- Review any feedback from early outreach
- Iterate on the product based on what we've learned
- Prepare week 1 growth plan

Come to me with blockers only — things that genuinely require my action (account credentials, 
approvals for external actions). Everything else, handle yourself.

Report at 8am, 2pm, and 8pm each day.
```

## Prompt 4: The Revenue Audit

Use when growth stalls. Forces your agent to diagnose the real problem.

```
We've been at [$X MRR / $X total revenue] for [X weeks]. I want to understand why we're not growing faster.

Do a full revenue audit:

1. Conversion analysis: Of everyone who saw our product/offer, what % bought? Where are people dropping off?

2. Customer interviews: Review all customer emails and feedback. What do our best customers say about why they bought? What almost stopped them?

3. Competitive landscape: Who else is solving this problem? What are they charging? What are customers saying about them?

4. Distribution analysis: Where did our customers come from? Which channels have we tried? Which haven't we tried?

5. Product-market fit signal: What's our NPS or satisfaction level? Are customers referring others?

Based on this audit, give me your top 3 recommended experiments to try in the next 2 weeks, 
ranked by expected revenue impact. Be specific — I want experiment names, hypotheses, and success metrics.
```

## Prompt 5: The Marketing Machine

For building repeatable, autonomous marketing systems.

```
I want you to design and build a daily marketing system you can run autonomously.

The goal: generate [X] new leads or visitors per day without me being involved.

Research and propose:
1. The 2-3 highest-leverage marketing channels for [OUR PRODUCT / AUDIENCE]
2. A daily content schedule you can execute independently
3. Any tools or automations we need to set up (and what API keys you'd need from me)
4. How we'll measure success (specific metrics, checked how often)

Then build as much of it as you can without needing my approval:
- Drafts, templates, scheduling queues
- Automations using tools we already have access to
- An SEO plan if our product has search intent

Leave me a list of anything that requires my sign-off before going live.
```
